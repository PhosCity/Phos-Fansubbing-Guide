# Introduction

## What is Typesetting?

Typesetting in the context of subtitles refers to the step in fansubbing where
translation of a text in a video is formatted to match the visual and stylistic
elements of the original text. It involves choosing fonts, colors, sizes, and
effects to make the text both readable and aesthetically pleasing. Unlike basic
subtitles, typesetting also includes positioning, styling, and animation to match
on-screen elements like signs, labels, or effects.

## The Main Goal of Typesetting

A well-done typesetting enhances the viewer's experience by ensuring subtitles
blend seamlessly into the video rather than feeling like an someone has added
the text later on.

A good typesetting:

1. Helps translate and replace on-screen text naturally.
1. Makes subtitles easy to read without distracting viewer from the scene.
1. Preserves the artistic intent of the original video.

### Information

Do not forget that a typesetted sign has to convey some information to the viewer.
No matter how fancy the typeset is, if it fails to convey that information,
the typesetting has failed. This makes readability of the sign an important factor
of a typesetting too.

However, not all signs are meant to be legible. If the original text is meant to
be cryptic or sloppily written to the point where it is difficult to understand,
the readability of the sign has to be sacrificed to the similar degree.

The effect of typesetting should be the same that the original text has to its
targeted audience.

### Blending with the Scene

- A typesetted sign should not feel like someone came later and added it.
  It should blend into the scene.
- Matching the font to the original text in the scene.
- Using the right colors.
- Aligning text properly.
- Matching the motion of the original text.

### Efficiency

- Typesetting is also about efficiency i.e. getting the best results with the least
  effort. Some typesetters will spend multiple hours on a single sign to be pixel-perfect,
  while others will are satisfied by much less. I will not say which approach is
  better; the key is to balance effort with quality.
- If a viewer won’t notice small imperfections in real-time playback, it may not
  be worth the extra effort.
- Spending too much time on small details can lead to burnout and frustration.
- Automation tools (scripts, templates) exist to speed up repetitive work.
  Use them whenever possible.

## Subtitle Format

The subtitle format we will be using is called `Advanced Sub Station Alpha` (*.ass).
This was derived from another SSA format created by
[Kotus](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618072944/http://www.eswat.demon.co.uk/).
This is essentially a subtitle format made by fansubbers for the fansubbers.

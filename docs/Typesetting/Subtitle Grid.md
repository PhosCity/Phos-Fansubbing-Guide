!!! tip

    Act out what the guide is talking about. If it talks about a menu, click on
    it. If it talks about a hotkey, press it. Learn by practice and not reading.
    Otherwise it is going to be a long boring read.

## Selecting Multiple Lines

You can select multiple lines my pressing ++ctrl++ and clicking the lines you
want to select. If you want to select a range of lines, click on the first line
then press ++shift++ while clicking on the last line. All the lines from the
first to last line will be selected. When you select multiple lines, the last
line you select will be the active line.

!!! info

    If multiple lines are selected, the changes made in the edit box will modify
    all lines in the same way.

## Color of Lines in Subtitle Grid

Lines in subtitle grid will have different background or foreground depending on
the properties of the line. These colors can all be changed in the settings.
By default, selected lines have green background. Commented lines have blue
background. Lines with red text overlap in time with active line.

It allows you to paste any given field(s) of one or more lines to the corresponding fields of other lines, without affecting the other fields. <br> To use it, first copy one or more lines with the familiar copy function (right-click -> copy, or Ctrl+C). Then select the line(s) you want to paste to, and click paste lines over (or press Ctrl+Shift+V) <br>Tick the fields you want to paste (the buttons below the checkboxes can be used to select all fields (in which case paste over is almost the same as normal pasting except it replaces existing lines instead of inserting new ones), no fields (in which case it does nothing), just the text field, or both time fields) and press OK. The fields you selected will then be pasted.<br> Do note that the paste over function isn’t limited to using lines copied from Aegisub itself; you are free to copy correctly formatted lines from any text editor, chat program, web browser etc. etc. |

## Columns of Subtitle Grid

The columns of subtitle grid are as follows:
![subtitle grid column](./assets/Subtitle Grid/columns.png)

By default, the following columns are visible:

| Item | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| # | The line number |
| Start | The start time/frame of the line |
| End | The end time/frame of the line |
| CPS | Number of characters per second of the line |
| Style | The style used for this line |
| Text | The text of the line (which is dispalyed on the video) |

The following columns will be displayed if any line in the file uses them:

| Item | Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| > | Folds<br>_Folds will be explained later in guide_ |
|L | The layer of the line |
| Actor | The actor speaking the line |
| Effect | The effect for this line |
| Left | The left margin for this line|
| Right | The right margin for this line |
| Vert | The vertical margin for this line |

## Override Tags in Subtitle Grid

There are three ways the override tags can be presented in subtitle grid.

=== "Simplify Tags"

    ![simple mode](./assets/Subtitle Grid/override_tags_asterik.png) 

=== "Hide Tags"

    ![no tags](./assets/Subtitle Grid/override_tags_none.png) 

=== "Show Tags"

    ![show tags](./assets/Subtitle Grid/override_tags_full.png) 

As you can see, if you show all the tags, it becomes very messy. I recommended
you to keep it in `Simplify Tags` mode. To change it, go to `View` menu in the
`Menu Bar`.

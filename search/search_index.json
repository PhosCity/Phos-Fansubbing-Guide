Although it was briefly updated in 2015 and 2018, the content of the guide remained largely the same. During that time, a lot changed and while the guide was sufficient to teach a beginner the basics of typesetting, they were also expected to learn much more after it for which there was no singular source to learn from.</p> <p>The knowledge was spread throughout various discord channels and was taught mostly through word-of-mouth. Some attempts were made to consolidate them: pins in discord or fansubbing wiki to which I have made few contributions myself. However, a single source that covers them did not emerge as I'm beginning to write this guide.</p> <p>My goal in writing this guide is pretty simple: I want there to be a place I and other fansubbers can link to when someone asks, \"How do I learn typesetting?\". I also want to know when a beginner has not done their due diligence and hasn't tried to learn the basics using the resources that are available to them. I want someone who has never typesetted in their life before, never even heard of Aegisub before, read this guide from start to finish and be caught up with the current method of typesetting.</p>"},{"location":"Typesetting/Background/#about-this-guide","title":"About this guide","text":"<p>When I began to write this guide, the first thing I did was write the table of contents for the guide.

However, I scrapped that idea pretty fast as I concluded people who learn it that way will always be limited by what those scripts can do.</p> <p>This is why there will be a lot of reading in this guide before you typeset a single sign. This is because I want you to start from the very basics and move up from there. So when you learn about Aegisub scripts, you should know that you have learned the basics and are now ready to do the real typesetting.</p> <p>This guide is still a work in progress.

Since typesetting is all about changing how the text looks and behaves, learning override tags is one of the most important skill for a typesetter.

There are much more to come and we will learn them as we need them.</p> <p>Until now, we have learned that we can put text in the edit box. In that text, a tag block, enclosed within curly braces <code>{}</code>, is added at different point of the text in order to change the behaviour of that line after the tag block. A tag block can have multiple tags and each tag inside a tag block starts with a backslash <code>\\</code> followed by a name of the tag and then the parameter of the tag.</p> <pre><code>{\\&lt;tag_name&gt;&lt;tag_parameter&gt;}\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>A parameter for a tag can be omitted. In such case, the default value from the line's style is used.</p> <p>There are two categories of tags: <code>Global tags</code> and <code>Local tags</code>. Global tags change the property of the whole line. They should appear only once in a line in the first tag block. Local tags modify all the text after the tag until the end of the line or until the property is overridden or disabled.</p> <p>They are also classified between <code>Transformable tags</code> and <code>Untransformable tags</code> but we will discuss transforming tags later in the guide.</p> <p>A tag block is classified between <code>Start tags</code> and <code>Inline tags</code>.
